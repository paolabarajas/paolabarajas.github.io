> I studied biology in Bogota and moved to Germany to pursue a Master's in Geoecology. At Goettingen University, I became Dr.rer.nat (aka Ph.D.) focusing my research on plant functional ecology, exploring the influences of evolution and biogeography on the form and function of plant biodiversity.
>
> Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Biodiversity Synthesis group at iDiv, Germany. My research interests revolve around the spatial and temporal dynamics of biodiversity -I mainly work with plants and birds- with a focus on identifying what is causing current changes in biodiversity.
>
> I am particularly motivated to build bilateral research capacity in Latin America and other megadiverse regions that are underrepresented in international biodiversity research
