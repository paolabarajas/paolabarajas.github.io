Biodiversity research is very important for tackling the global biodiversity crisis we are facing today. Yet, our field struggles with inclusivity challenges, often neglecting or not recognizing enough local expertise from economically disadvantaged, biodiversity-rich regions. This oversight hinders comprehensive progress and tends to undervalue diverse perspectives.

To drive real advancement, we must broaden our understanding across diverse contexts and foster meaningful collaborations that amplify the diverse voices of local researchers from such biodiverse regions. Collaboration is a cornerstone in biodiversity research, necessitating improved equitable practices. This means that we need to cultivate environments of open communication and mutual respect, as well as address our own unconscious biases and disadvantageous cultural and historical legacies. 

My biodiversity research colleagues and I are preparing a publication addressing the inclusivity issues and we propose strategies to address them. You can check it here: Valdez J., Damasceno G., Oh R., Quintero Uribe L.C., Barajas Barbosa M.P., . & Sharma S. Advancing Inclusive Biodiversity Research: Strategies for Equitable Practices and Collective Impact. In press in Conservation Biology. Preprint https://doi.org/10.1590/SciELOPreprints.7623
